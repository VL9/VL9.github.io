				<h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
				<p>I'm Vu, a coding bootcamp graduate from General Assembly, Australia looking for job opportunities in Singapore.</p>

				<p>It wasn't until I spent a few days creating a website for my side company that I realised how much I enjoyed working on websites. Following that, I decided to pursue my newfound passion by enrolling in the web development course at General Assembly.</p>

				<p>I love the problem solving and design aspects of coding and enjoy the challenges of learning new things hence this industry felt like the perfect match. I believe in creating a great user experience by building a functional web app that takes users on journeys.</p>

				<p>My love for travelling and exploring new experiences has led me to my recent move to Singapore. Here are some of the guilty pleasures that I like to enjoy whilst not coding.<span class="dynamo" data-lines="🏀,🍦,🚴,🕹,🎾">🍣</span></p>
